    <h2>What is an LED?</h2>
    <p>
        An LED, short for light-emitting diode, is a device that takes electricity and converts it to light. They can have many different colours, 
        require different voltages, and have varying brightness depending on what type of LED they are. There are 
        simple LEDs smaller than your pinkie, yet can light up an entire room. There are huge LED flashlights that emit dim lights.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are way too many different types of LED's to list here, and many of them are produced by different manufacturers. But generally, LEDs have 
        a voltage of 1.7 or more, and the actual LED part(so excluding the shell) is quite small, and usually do not measure more than 1cm in any direction. 
        LEDs are generally considered the brightest electrical component compared to the amount of electricity they use. 
    </p>
    <h2>What is it made of?</h2>
    <p>
        The material of the LED depends on what color it is designed to display. Some LED's can display more than 1 colour, which means that they are 
        made of multiple types of these materials.

    <h2>What does it do and how does it work?</h2>
    <p>
        LEDs convert electricity into light. Put simply, the electrical current runs through the LED, and the energy is emitted as light. LEDs usually have 2
        terminals that receive the electricity so that it can be used to produce light.
    </p>
    <p>
        LED's are used for lighting, as that is its only function. The light may be used to illuminate an area, or just to indicate signals. For example,
        they might be used in a flashlight, where large amounts of illumination might be required. They are also commonly used in or beside power buttons
        on computers or monitors to show if the computer is on or off.
