        <h2>Your guide to electronic components</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to eparts! This is a website dedicated to information about electronic parts, such as batteries, resistors,
             circuits and more! Click on one of the links on the top navigation bar to learn about specific parts, continue reading
             for a brief description of each part, or visit the sources page for the credits to the information and images.

            Electronic components are defined as any component in an electronical system. They provide various uses such as converting
            electricity, resisting current, and much more. They are used in everything involving electricity, such as computers, lights,
            even things like planes use electronic components. This site will discuss the most common and important electrical components
            that we use.

        <h2><a href="home/battery.html">Battery</a></h2>
        <p>
            Batteries are simple devices used to store electricity. They release it slowly, and can is used as a supply of power when other
            power options aren't available. They are very common and are found in everything from phones to remote controllers.
        </p>
        <h2><a href="home/capacitor.html">Capacitor</a></h2>
        <p>
            Like the battery, capacitors hold energy. But instead of releasing the power slowly, it almost instantly dumps all of it as soon
            as it gets a chance. They vary extremely depending on their use, and how much power they need to hold.
        </p>
        <h2><a href="home/circuit.html">Circuit</a></h2>
        <p>
            A circuit is a system of electronic components and wires and/or other connective materials to let electricity flow through the system.
            It is not a single component, but rather a network of them.
        </p>
        <h2><a href="home/led.html">Led</a></h2>
        <p>
            An LED, or light-emitting diode, is a small electrical component that emits light when powered by electricity. The light they emit can have 
            varying amounts of brightness, and use varying amounts of power. They are used as lighting, or to just simply display things.
        </p>
        <h2><a href="home/resistor.html">Resistor</a></h2>
        <p>
            A resistor is a tiny electrical component made out of really really long wires curled up together into a small space. They are used to resist 
            the amount of power in the circuit to prevent circuits from burning out or damaging itself because of power excess.
