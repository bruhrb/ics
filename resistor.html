    <h2>What is a Resistor?</h2>
    <p>
        A resistor is a very important component in the electrical world. They might seem counter-intuitive, as they resist current, and basically take 
        power away from your circuit. But they have a very practical use. You see, power sources will flow to the end of the circuit regardless if the 
        circuit can handle that much electricity. And in some cases, the extreme amount of power can cause a tremendous amount of heat, and even destroy 
        certain parts of the circuit altogether. And if there is still extra power at the end, they can short circuit the power source.
    </p>
    <p> 
        This is why it's a good idea to make sure that your circuit can handle the amount of power provided by your power source. There are 2 ways to do 
        this. One method is to reduce the power of the source. While this method is viable, it's fairly inconvenient, as most power sources come from a 
        set power strength. For example, almost all power outlets in houses have somewhere around 120 volts. In this case, you can't modify the power 
        source, and can only use the second method of using a resistor.
    </p>
    <h2>What is it made of?</h2>
    <p>
        Resistors are basically just a really long wire wrapped in a cylinder, coated with a shell of plastic. The wire can be made out of many different 
        conducting materials such as carbon, metal types, or other conductive materials. 
    </p>
    <h2>What does it do and how does it work?</h2>
    <p>
        Resistors like its name states resist the current in a circuit. This makes the current less powerful so that it's easier for the circuit to handle. 
        However, they do resist the current, so you have to make sure that the power supply is strong enough to power both the resistor and the circuit. If 
        not, consider getting a weaker resistor. For example, if an <a href="led.html">LED</a> requires 3 volts, and the power source is a 9 volt battery,
        the battery will overpower the LED and damage it. However, you can get a 6 volt resistor, and that will resist 6 volts so that there are 3 left, just 
        enough to power the battery and not go over.
