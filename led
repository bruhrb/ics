    <h2>What is an LED?</h2>
    <p>
        An LED, short for light-emmiting diode, is a device that takes electricity and converts it to light. They can have many different colors, require 
        different <a href="/electricity.html">voltages</a>, and have varying brightness depending on what type of LED they are. There are simple LEDs smaller than your pinkie, yet can 
        light up an entire room. There are huge LED flashlights that emit dim lights.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are way too many different types of LED's to list here, and many of them are produced by different manufacturers. But generally, LEDs have 
        a <a href = "/electricity.html">voltage</a> of 1.7 or more, and the actual LED part(so excluding the shell) is quite small, and usually not bigger
        than 1cm in any direction. LEDs are generally considered the brightest electrical component compared to the amount of electricity they use.
