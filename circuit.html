    <h2>What is a circuit?</h2>
    <p>
        A circuit is a system of electrical components combined with wires and/or other connective parts to transport electricity. 
        It's referred to as the entire system of electrical components, not just a single one. That's why circuits aren't electrical 
        components, but rather the complete puzzle. Almost all working electrical systems count as circuits. A circuit may seem 
        simple, but there are still many types of circuits. There are open circuits, closed circuits, series circuits, and parallel 
        circuits. Here's a table explaining how each of them works.
    </p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Circuit type</th>
            <th>Explanation</th>
            <th>Compatibility</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Open circuit</th>
            <th>Open circuits are not functional. In order for circuits to work, they must be able to flow from the negative terminal to the positive. If the circuit is open, that cannot happen.</th>
            <th>Since it is not functional, it can't be a series or parallel circuit.</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Closed circuit</th>
            <th>Closed circuits are different, they allow electricity to flow from start to finish, meaning that they can power the components. All finished circuits should be closed.</th>
            <th>A closed circuit can also be a series circuit or a parallel circuit.</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Series circuit</th>
            <th>
                A series circuit is where the entire circuit runs on one path. This is slightly problematic because if the path breaks, it essentially becomes an open circuit. 
                Pros are that it's simple to make and takes less space.
            </th>
            <th>Can be a closed circuit when it's functional, and a open circuit when it breaks.</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Parallel circuit</th>
            <th>
                Parallel circuits are circuits that make the electrons break up before joining again. It's like a dam splitting the water into 2 channels, so if one channel is blocked, 
                the second one remains functional.
            </th>
            <th>Is a closed circuit, and an open circuit if broken.</th>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
        As you can see, open circuits are considered either broken, or just not functional. Closed circuits can be either parallel or series, 
        with series being more simple and easier to make, and parallel harder to break. Because parallel has somewhat of a "failsafe", it's 
        the type of circuit we use in most of our houses.
    </p>
    <h2>What is it made of and what is it used for?</h2>
    <p>
        Circuits can be made of many different types of materials. Circuits themselves, as we established, aren't a component by themselves. 
        They are a system. So the material they're made out of depends on what the components are made out of. With that being said, there 
        are circuit boards that circuits lie on. The most common type, the printed circuit boards vary by manufacturer, but most of the time 
        the board is made out of some type of resin and the wires are replaced with a foil-like shape made out of copper. The other electrical 
        components are soldered onto it, and the solder materials can contain tin, copper, zinc, and other materials as well.
    </p>
    <p>
        Circuits are like the complete form of an electrical component. They can be as simple as a battery connected to a lightbulb, 
        or as complicated as many of the products you use today, like computers, refrigerators, and many more. They are used in almost 
        everything that even remotely deals with electricity. They heavily impact our day to day lives, usually for the better. They make 
        our lives more convenient, more productive and helps us do many many things that we couldn't do without them.
