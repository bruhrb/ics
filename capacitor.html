    <h1>Capacitor</h1>

    <h2>What is a capacitor?</h2>
    <p>A capacitor is a device similar to a battery, but it releases all its energy at once instead of
        releasing it gradually. Like the battery, it stores energy and keeps it until needed.
        Capacitors have many modern-day uses and are one of the most common electrical components. Because it releases all of 
        its energy at once, it's not measured with mAh. Instead, it is measured with farads. 
        The more farads it has, the more energy it can contain. Common household capacitors may only have a millifarad or less, 
        while huge industrial capacitors can have thousands of farads. An interesting natural example of the capacitor is lightning.
        One side of the capacitor is in the ground, and the other side of the capacitor is the storm. The distance between the 
        ground and the clouds is small enough that the electricity can flow through them and create lightning.
    </p>
    <p>There are 6 different types of capacitors.

    <p>Each different capacitor has its own different pros, cons, and uses.</p>
    <h2>What is it made of?</h2>
    <p>
        Different capacitors are made of different materials. Usually, they're made of parts of metal, certain chemical compounds,
        and plastic of some sort. They vary extremely in size and material depending on what type of capacitor it is and its use.
    </p>
    <p>
        Capacitors are used to store electricity for later use. They are used in almost every electrical component. Capacitors 
        can be used in situations where there is excess electricity. The excess is stored in the capacitors, and saved until there 
        is a shortage. They are also used in place of the battery when higher voltages are 
        required.
    </p>
    <h2>What does it do and how does it work?</h2>
    <p>
        Capacitors can also have different uses besides just storing electricity. For example, it can condition power, it can be 
        used as a sensor, they can process signals, and more. They are a very versatile electrical component and thus are used very commonly.
    </p>
    <p>Different capacitors work differently, but they all have a few parts in common. An outer shell that protects the inside,
        an insulator that separates the positive side from the negative, and the output and input terminals. When the terminals 
        are connected, electricity rushes through and is used up.
