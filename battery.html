    <h2>What is a battery?</h2>
    <p>A battery is a device used to store electricity. They are like <a href = "/capacitor.html">capacitors</a>, 
        but they release their electricity slowly instead of dumping it all at once. Batteries can have varied 
        voltage and mAh/Ah(MilliAmpHours/AmpHours) depending on the use of the 
        battery and the quality of the battery. For example, a car battery might have 12 volts or so and 10 
        AmpHours, while a toy helicopter might have 6 volts and 500 MilliAmpHours. The more AmpHours it has, the 
        longer the battery life, while the higher the voltage, the more energy is contained in each electron. So 
        the total amount of energy contained requires both amps and volts. This energy is measured as watts.
    </p>
    <p>There are multiple types of batteries, and what materials they're made out of varies as well. The most common 
        type of battery is the carbon-zinc battery. Most AAA, AA, and commercial 12V batteries are batteries of this 
        type. These batteries are cheap to manufacture and last for a decent amount of time. However,
        these batteries are one use only and cannot be recharged, and are thrown away after they are done with.
        Other battery types include lithium-ion batteries. They are small, can hold large amounts of energy,
        and charge quickly, but aren't as durable as other battery types and don't last as long as others.
        Nickel Metal Hydride (NiMH) can't hold as much energy and take a long time to charge, but they last much 
        longer and are safer. 
    </p>
    <h2>What is it made of?</h2>
    <p>
        What a battery is made out of varies on the type of battery. Batteries types are classified usually by what 
        material they're made out of, like lithium-ion, carbon-zinc, and nickel-metal hydride. Their main materials 
        are in the name, although they can have an outer shell made of aluminum or steel, and perhaps some plastic 
        if it's a commercial battery. One such example is the AA battery, which is made of mostly carbon and zinc, 
        while also having an outer shell made of aluminum and steel coated with a plastic wrapping to display info.

    <p>
        Batteries are used to power electronic devices. Different devices require different battery types. High drain 
        devices require batteries with longer battery life, and an extremely powerful device might need both high amperage and high voltage.
    </p>
    <h2>What does it do and how does it work?</h2>
    <p>
        How a battery works depends on what type of battery it is. Generally, they consist of the anode(the negative 
        side), the cathode, the positive side, and the electrolyte, the place where electricity is stored. In a 
        nutshell, the electrons want to flow from the anode to the cathode, but the battery prevents them from doing that. 
        To do so, you must attach some sort of connection between the two sides. While electricity flows through 
        the connection, it powers everything it goes through if it has enough energy. If extra energy is left and not used 
        while the electrons are flowing, the energy is mostly converted to heat and lost.
